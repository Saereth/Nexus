# Nexus
Magic Mod aimed at utilities such as teleportation and physics magic utilizing leylines and nexus points found in the world, 
magic language is arabic inspired for flavor

Overall Goals:
Mystcraft teleportation using leyline redirection iterdimensionally and Nexus focal points (requires 2 intersecting ley lines) for interdimensional rift creation (Note the rift core is formed there and then contained in a Qur'a Matrix until ready to be used. Leylines and Nexus have a set amount of Qur'a (randomly determined at worldgen) and recharge over time. Recharging can be speadup via sacrificial magics, blood letting, animal or monster sacrifices all increase the stored Qur'a in a nexus or leyline. If a nexus is drained too low (<10%) it will start tearing about the land in a desperate attemtp to sustain itself (Similar to a hungry node)

Magic system that allows the player to bend, and break the laws of physics using the magic that connects and binds reality 
itself to obtain direct manipulation of the weave. 

Rifts - Tears in reality - High end portion of the game, easier rifts can be created for just teleportation with difficulty
similar to that of mystcraft, a single rift can also be linked to multiple rifts in this way to cycle through. A rift linked
to mulple rifts will cycle its destination once every 2 seconds displaying a glyph representation of its target (or better 
an actual image similar to some CCTV mods, if this could be done without chunk loading every destination point) a rift 
stabilizer will allow you to lock on to a destination once a redstone signal is supplied. CC/OC integration here would 
be cool.

Folds - these are similar to rifts but the cant link to multiple targets, each fold comes in a multiblock pair, this would 
allow for transdimensional transmission of anything passing through, the multiblock itself would allow for expandability 
of the rift to put more cabling/conduits/people etc through the rift. It would need to be the same size structure on both 
sides (ie 4x5 or w/e, 1x1 being the smallest) before it can be initialized. 

Research system:
Learn by doing/experimentation similar to ars magica, mix and match combinations of Sok'as which are uncovered via 
exploration and trading with others. Primal Sok'as; Elemental, Consciousness, Destiny, Destruction, Creation. Using a 
combination of these runes (Up to 4) the player can design spells that are powerd with Qua'ra. The amount of power put 
into a spell on cast (by channeling with right click) determines magnitude, damage, duration and invokes extra effects
depending on the spell, a full write up of intended spells and combinations will follow in the future as well as proper 
naming.

Worldgen:
Invisible leylines, they need to worldgen similar to thaumcraft nodes but only visible with the right items. These 
leylines and nexus point will provide inspiration attunments when visited across the world, different biomes offering 
different inspirations. The inspirations are used in the research system or can be traded. ie If I travel for a few 
thousand meters and collect 4 Elemental inspirations, 2 Destiny Inspirations and a Creation elemental I can inscribe 
one of my Elemental inspirations on a Tok'rah using some of my stored Qua'ra and trade that to another player. I lose 
one of my stored Elmenetal in the process but will gain the one they trade me after reading their Tok'rah.
